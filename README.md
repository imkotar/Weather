# Weather App
This is my first project made completley from scratch with usage of Java, HTML and CSS.
It is a simple web-app which takes a city name from user as an input, reads API response
from openweathermap.org and then shows the temperature, pressure etc. 
This app is being constantly improved, as well as my programming skills (I am mostly a self-learner).
